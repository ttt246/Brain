# RisingBrain
WIP: This codebase is under active development and recently opened to the public. 

All complex software including operating systems will need to be rewritten from the ground up to take advantage of machine learning. In our OS, a AI will manage all apps via plugins, which can be prompted by the user. Our plugins can run as an openai plugin, or in our backend.

#### 2.1 how to run on local
It's a standard fastapi application so no configuration is needed beyond the included Procfile
#### 2.2 Create firebase project
Create firebase project and take its credentials named .json from Google Cloude IAM. 
#### 2.3 Get Heroku Api key
Deploy it to Heroku in CI/CD automatically whenever there are some changes in main or develop branch.
#### 2.4 Set Github Secrets With its Access Keys
All credentials including openai, replicate and pinecone are shared with Github Secrets to be referenced by Unit Tests of CI/CD on its building
